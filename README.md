# Customer Churn Prediction with Random Forest

This project builds a machine learning model to predict telecom customer churn and identify key drivers behind customer loss. The model helps inform business decisions and customer retention strategies.

---

# Objective
- Predict customer churn using Random Forest classifier
- Analyze key drivers using feature importance
- Provide actionable insights for reducing churn

---

# Performance
- Accuracy: **79.5%**
- Precision (churn): **66%**
- Recall (churn): **50%**
- Model: Random Forest Classifier

---

# Key Insights
- Customers with **month-to-month contracts**, **low tenure**, or **no tech support** are most likely to churn
- Service-related features significantly impact churn likelihood
- Model feature importances guide targeted retention strategies

---

# Tools Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn, matplotlib
